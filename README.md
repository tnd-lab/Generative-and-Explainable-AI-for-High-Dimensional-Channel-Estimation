## Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework for high-dimensional instantaneous channel estimation in wireless communications. Specifically, we train a generative adversarial network to predict channel realizations in the time-frequency-space domain. The generator incorporates the third-order moment of the input in its loss function and employs a new reparameterization method for latent distribution learning, aiming to minimize the Wasserstein distance between true and estimated channel distributions.

Furthermore, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence mechanism to analyze how the critic differentiates the generated channels. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in minimizing estimation errors. Additionally, we observe that the critic primarily focuses on the high-power regions of the channelâ€™s time-frequency representation.
